      During her time in office, Abu Zayd worked on several different social
      issues. She strongly supported a law that prohibited Islamic oral
      repudiation and made it mandatory for a husband to go to court to be able
      to divorce his wife. In order to combat mendicity, she imposed prison
      terms on recidivist beggars who returned to begging after they had
      received state-sponsored training in handicrafts. In addition to
      registering NGOs and expanding their development activities, she launched
      projects aimed at improving the status of rural women. One of the most
      sensitive tasks assigned to Abu Zayd was the relocation of thousands of
      Nubians, displaced by the construction of the Aswan Dam, to newly built
      villages. Her management of the resettlement process led to her being
      nicknamed the "Merciful Heart of the Revolution" by Nasser. Nevertheless,
      the Nubians' forced displacement remains controversial in Egypt to this
      day, with some blaming Nasser for the neglectful conditions in which the
      relocated Nubians have been living since then.
